# blockchain-js

making a simple blockchain because I wanted to -_-

### thoughts

1. figure out how to better test the proof of work stuff without it taking forever
2. get better at testing in general -> implement the before/beforeEach stuff for the unit test setups
3. relearn the whole commit merge pull request flow
4. happy path and sad paths for testing -> need more sad paths
5. a little worried about the security of the chain so may add typescript to the chain for peace of mind
6. implement backend testing, look up what is industry standard now
